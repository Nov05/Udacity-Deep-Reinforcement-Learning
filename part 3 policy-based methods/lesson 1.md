# Study Plan

The third part of this nanodegree program covers policy-based methods in deep reinforcement learning. You can find all of the coding exercises from the lessons in this GitHub repository.

## Lessons

### Lesson: Introduction to Policy-Based Methods
In this lesson, you will learn about methods such as hill climbing, simulated annealing, and adaptive noise scaling. You'll also learn about cross-entropy methods and evolution strategies.

### Lesson: Policy Gradient Methods
In this lesson, you'll study REINFORCE, along with improvements we can make to lower the variance of policy gradient algorithms.

### Lesson: Proximal Policy Optimization
In this lesson, you'll learn about Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a cutting-edge policy gradient method.

### Lesson: Actor-Critic Methods
In this lesson, you'll learn how to combine value-based and policy-based methods, bringing together the best of both worlds, to solve challenging reinforcement learning problems.

### Lesson: Deep RL for Finance (Optional)
In this optional lesson, you'll learn how to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques for optimal execution of portfolio transactions.

### Resources (Optional)
* Read the most famous blog post on policy gradient methods.
* Implement a policy gradient method to win at Pong in this Medium post.
* Learn more about evolution strategies from OpenAI.
